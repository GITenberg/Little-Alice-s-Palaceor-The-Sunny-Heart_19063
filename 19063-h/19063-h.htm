<h2><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
5</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>The rain was pattering, pattering steadily upon the roof of a 
little brown cottage that stood alone by the country 
roadside.</p>
<p>There had been a long and dreary winter, and now the bright 
spring was coming, with its buds and leaves and flowers, to 
gladden the earth, that had all the time seemed to be dead.</p>
<p>As the shower came down, the little green blades of grass 
sprang up to catch the drops; and they seemed <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>almost to laugh
and sing, so full of joy were they when they could lift their 
heads from the dust.</p>
<p>It was so much sweeter to be out once more from their 
prison-house and to exult with all God&rsquo;s fair creation; so 
they bathed themselves in the falling shower, and made themselves
fresh and clean; and nobody would ever have believed that they 
came out from their dark beds in the earth.</p>
<p>Little Alice looked out of the windows of the brown cottage, 
and saw them nodding gaily to her as they were taking their bath;
and so she smiled back again, and talked to them from her perch 
in the window-seat as if they were brothers and sisters, with 
eyes and ears to see and hear, and hearts to return her 
love.&nbsp; Indeed, there was no one else to whom she could talk 
the livelong day.&nbsp; No father, for he was dead; no living 
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>brothers and sisters; no mother at home, for they were 
very poor, and her mother must be gone at early dawn to labour 
for their food and clothing and shelter;&mdash;and so Alice had 
to make companions of the blades of grass that nodded at her 
through the drops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you beauties!&rdquo; said she gladly; &ldquo;and I 
know who made you, too, and what a great, good God he is to send 
you here&mdash;bright little creatures that you are.&nbsp; How 
pleasant it will be down by the brook-side when the sun comes 
out, and you and I and the blue violets and the dandelions have 
our visiting-time together!&nbsp; Never a little girl had such 
joy as I have!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Alice put her face close to the 
pane, and looked up into the sky to thank her kind heavenly 
Father for sending her such blessings.&nbsp; It seemed as if she 
could see him bending <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>graciously down towards her, as her 
Sunday-school teacher had often represented him to her; and then 
she thought of Him who was upon the earth, and who took up little
children in his arms and blessed them; and she put out her hands 
towards the heavens, saying earnestly, &ldquo;Me, too, dear 
Saviour: bless me too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So absorbed was she that she didn&rsquo;t hear anybody enter 
the room until a timid voice said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were you speaking to, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such a woful figure by the door as she turned her 
head&mdash;no bonnet, no shoes, and a tattered frock, all 
draggled with dirt and rain, and the long, uncombed locks 
straggling about the child&rsquo;s shoulders, and such a blue, 
pinched look in the thin face!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Maddie, is it?&rdquo; said Alice, 
jumping from the window and <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>taking the hand
of the new-comer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it was a pity to get so 
wet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll 
keep house together till it clears away, and then maybe 
we&rsquo;ll have a nice walk.&nbsp; First we must dry your 
clothes, though.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she put some sticks in the 
fireplace, and putting a match to them, stationed Maddie before 
the blaze, while she held the skirt out to dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pleasant here?&rdquo; asked Alice, with 
a beaming smile.</p>
<p>Maddie looked around, with a half shrug, upon the cheerless 
room, with its bit of a table and the one chair and the low, 
curtainless window, and then her eyes fell upon the scantily-clad
little girl by her side; and then she shivered, as the dampness 
of her clothes sent a creeping chill through her frame; but she 
didn&rsquo;t say it was pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to stay here so <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>much 
alone, Alice?&rdquo; she asked, giving another glance about the 
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never stay <i>alone</i>, Maddie!&rdquo; answered 
the dear child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have plenty of 
company&mdash;&lsquo;Tabby,&rsquo; and the flies, and now and 
then a spider, and everything that goes by the door, and the 
clouds and the sunshine and the leaves and the&mdash;oh dear! so 
many things, Maddie, that I can&rsquo;t begin to tell 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she stopped short for want of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And somebody you were talking to.&nbsp; Who was 
that?&rdquo; asked Maddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, best of all!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know, 
Maddie?&rdquo; said Alice, sinking her voice to a whisper, and 
gazing earnestly at her young companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Mason 
told me how He is everywhere, and sees and hears us, and that he 
loves us better than our mother or father can do, and watches 
over us and keeps us from all harm.&nbsp; <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>If you go to 
the school with me you&rsquo;ll learn all about it, Maddie 
dear.&nbsp; No, no; I&rsquo;m never <i>alone</i> though mother 
<i>is gone</i> all the long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you <i>see</i> Him, Alice?&rdquo; asked Maddie 
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I see <i>you</i>, Maddie,&rdquo; returned her 
companion with reverence; &ldquo;but when I look up into the sky,
and sometimes when I sit here by myself and speak things that I 
have learned from my Bible, I seem to feel some strange 
brightness all above and around me; and it&rsquo;s so real to me 
that it&rsquo;s just like seeing with these eyes.&nbsp; Miss 
Mason says &lsquo;it&rsquo;s my soul that sees.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s very beautiful, Maddie.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
And Alice clasped her hands in a sort of ecstasy, and drew near 
to the window to look up once more into the heavens, whither her 
eyes and her heart so continually turned.</p>
<h2><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>The shower did not last long, and the warm sun melted the 
diamonds from the grass, so that it was soon fit for the little 
girls to go out into the freshness and enjoy the pleasant 
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think this a pretty cottage?&rdquo; 
asked Alice, as they stepped outside and stood looking upon her 
home.&nbsp; &ldquo;See the moss all over the shingles; how 
velvety it is!&nbsp; Tabby goes up there to sleep on the soft 
cushion in the sun.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s where I put my 
convolvuluses, and they climb up and run all over the window and 
make such a nice curtain, with the pink and blue and white and 
purple mixed with the green; and they reach up to the very 
chimney, Maddie, and hug it round, and then trail down upon the 
roof.&nbsp; Oh, I think it&rsquo;s elegant!&nbsp; And 
here&rsquo;s my <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>flower-bed, right under the window, 
where mother can smell the blossoms as we sit sewing when she has
a day at home.&nbsp; We take real comfort here, mother and I, 
Maddie.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the little blithesome child prattled 
about her humble home, while her companion looked in astonishment
upon her, wondering why it was that Alice always seemed so happy,
while <i>she</i> was so miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down by the brook-side now,&rdquo; said 
Alice.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my grand palace.&nbsp; Such 
hangings! all blue and gold and crimson; and carpets that your 
feet sink into; and a great mirror, such as the richest man 
couldn&rsquo;t buy.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know what I mean, 
Maddie?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Alice laughed gleefully as they reached 
the brook-side, and pointed to the heavens above, so brilliant in
the sunny radiance, and down to the green and flowery turf <!-- 
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>beneath their feet, and to the clear stream that 
reflected all things, like the purest glass.&nbsp; And she said, 
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you like my palace, Maddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very pretty here,&rdquo; said Maddie; 
but she didn&rsquo;t seem to feel about it as Alice did, who was 
in such good spirits that she could keep neither her feet nor her
tongue still, but frisked about the green like a young deer, and 
chattered like a magpie, only in far sweeter tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This</i> is my <i>bower</i>,&rdquo; said she, 
lifting up the drooping branches of a willow and shutting herself
and Maddie within.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I come for a nap when I am 
tired of play; and the leaves rustle in the wind, making a 
pleasant sound, and the birds sit on the boughs and sing me 
asleep, and I dream always happy dreams.&nbsp; When awake, I 
think about the pure river that my Bible <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>speaks of, 
and the tree of life that is on either side, and the beautiful 
light that isn&rsquo;t like the sun, nor the moon, nor the blaze 
of a candle, but comes from the face of God, and is never hidden 
from us to leave us in darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddie sat down upon a large stone that Alice called her 
throne, and looked eagerly up at her companion for more; for 
Alice&rsquo;s words seemed to her like some beautiful story out 
of a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever go into any great house, Maddie?&rdquo; 
asked Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; said Maddie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I passed by
Mrs. Cowper&rsquo;s one day, and looked in at the open door when 
somebody was coming out, but I couldn&rsquo;t see 
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where I went with mother,&rdquo; said
Alice; &ldquo;and little Mary took me into a high room, the walls
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>all velvet and satin and gold, so that my eyes ached for
looking; and there were such heaps of pretty things on the tables
and all about the place; but it didn&rsquo;t make me feel glad as
I do when I get out here in my grand palace with these living, 
breathing things around me.&nbsp; O Maddie, there isn&rsquo;t 
anything on earth so beautiful as what God has made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you stay out here always?&rdquo; asked Maddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Alice; &ldquo;that would be 
idle.&nbsp; When mother has work I stay at home to help 
her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learned to sew nicely now, and can save 
mother many a stitch.&nbsp; To-day&rsquo;s my holiday, and I can 
play with you as long as you please.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve brought 
some dinner, and we&rsquo;ll set a table in my 
dining-hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she took from her pocket a little 
parcel, and led Maddie from the bower to a hollow <!-- page 
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>near 
the brook, where was a flat rock, and there she spread her frugal
fare.</p>
<p>There were two pieces of homemade bread and a small slice of 
cold bacon, which she put upon leaves in the middle of the rocky 
table; and gathering some violets, she placed them in bunches 
here and there, till the table was sweet with their delicious 
fragrance.</p>
<p>Just as the children were about to help themselves to the 
food, there came some little tired feet over the grass; and a 
more forlorn figure than Maddie&rsquo;s stood a few yards off, 
looking shyly, but wistfully, at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Lolly, you may just run home again as quick as you
can,&rdquo; said Maddie sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t 
enough dinner for Alice and me.&nbsp; Go, now!&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
she went towards her and gave her a slight push, at which the 
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>child cried, but without turning away or making a step 
towards home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your sister?&rdquo; asked Alice, going up to 
Maddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she&rsquo;s always running after me,&rdquo; 
returned Maddie, with an ill-natured frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo; said Alice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
wish my sister Nellie had lived.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t be cross
to her, I know.&nbsp; Come here, Lolly: you shall have some of 
<i>my</i> dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she led the little grateful 
child to the wild table, that seemed to her like a fairy scene, 
with the fresh leaf-plates, and the pure sweet flowers breathing 
so delightfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother makes capital bread&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t she, 
Maddie?&rdquo; said Alice, as she ate her small portion with 
evident relish, while she shared the remnant with her guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Maddie,&rdquo; said she, as they finished the 
repast, &ldquo;you clear the <!-- page 19--><a 
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>table and 
wash the dishes, and Lolly and I&rsquo;ll go to my mirror to make
ourselves nice to sit down, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you the 
story my teacher told me the other day, if you would like to hear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddie gladly agreed to this; and Lolly gave herself up to the
gentle hands of her new friend, who took her to the brook and 
washed her face until the dirt all vanished and her cheeks were 
like two red roses.&nbsp; Then she took her pocket-comb, and, 
dipping it into the water, made the child&rsquo;s hair so smooth 
that Lolly didn&rsquo;t know herself when she looked into the 
brook, and asked, &ldquo;What little girl it was with such bright
eyes and fresh rosy cheeks?&rdquo;&nbsp; And when Alice told her 
that it was herself, she laughed with delight, and said 
&ldquo;she would come every day to dress herself by Alice&rsquo;s
mirror if she could look so nice.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>And then 
Alice and Maddie and Lolly went to the bower for the story.</p>
<p>Alice sat down on the grassy bank, and Lolly laid her head 
upon her friend&rsquo;s lap, while Maddie crowded close to her to
listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can remember it very 
well,&rdquo; said Alice; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell it as nearly 
as I can like Miss Mason.&nbsp; She called it &lsquo;The Little 
Exiled Princess,&rsquo; and this is it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl no bigger than Lolly 
here, sitting in the dirt by the roadside, crying.</p>
<p>Her frock was all ragged and soiled, and the tears had run 
over the dust upon her face, making it streaked, and disfiguring 
it sadly.</p>
<p>Altogether, she was a very miserable <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>little 
object, when a lady, walking along the road, suddenly came upon 
her, and stopped to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>As the lady gazed upon the strange, ragged little creature, 
there came tears into her eyes, and she said softly, as if 
speaking to herself,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would think that this is the daughter of a great 
King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child, seeing a beautiful lady before her, jumped from the
ground, and, with shame, began to shake herself from the dirt 
that clung to her garments; but the stranger, taking no notice of
her untidy condition, clasped the child&rsquo;s fingers in her 
white hand, and told her to lead her to her home.</p>
<p>It was a brown cottage, very like mine, only <i>that</i> one 
was hung with cobwebs, and the dust was an inch thick upon the 
floor, and the window <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>was so begrimmed that scarcely any 
light came through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the lady, as she stood upon the 
threshold and looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a broom!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she brushed away the
hanging webs, and made the floor neat and clean, and taught the 
child to wash the window, until the bright sun came in and played
about the floor and upon the walls; and then she made the little 
girl wash her face and hands, and put on a better frock, that she
found in the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my little princess,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;come 
outside for a while, in the fresh air, and I will talk to 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me &lsquo;little 
princess&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked the child, as they sat down upon 
the cottage-step, while the birds twittered about them and the 
sweet breath of summer touched their cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are the daughter of <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>a great 
King,&rdquo; said the lady, gently stroking her soft, brown hair,
that she had found so tangled and shaggy, but had made so nice 
and smooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was a poor man, and he lies in the 
graveyard,&rdquo; said the little girl, as she looked wonderingly
at her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I mean your heavenly Father,&rdquo; said the 
lady&mdash;&ldquo;he whom we call <span 
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Surely you have heard of him, my 
dear child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl said that she had heard of him; but, from what
she could learn, the lady knew that she looked upon him as one 
that is afar off; and she wished to teach her how very near he is
continually, even round about her bed and about her path, and 
spying out all her ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live here all alone, dear child?&rdquo; asked 
she kindly.</p>
<p>Her words were so sweet and gentle <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that they 
sounded like the murmur of the brook near the little 
child&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day long alone, while mother is away at her 
work,&rdquo; answered the child, with her eyes full of sad 
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you do with the weary hours?&nbsp; Do they 
not seem very dull and dreary to you?&rdquo; asked the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said the little one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
have nobody to play with or talk to; and I&rsquo;m glad when the 
night comes and I can creep into bed and shut my eyes and forget 
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if you had some kind friend ever near, to smile on
you and bless you,&mdash;somebody to whom you could tell all your
little sorrows as you are now doing to me?&rdquo; said the 
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would that be pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, indeed!&rdquo; returned the child.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Will you stay?&rdquo; for she had felt it very sweet to be
sitting there <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>with the kind lady&rsquo;s words 
falling like music upon her ear, and her heart was lighter and 
happier than it had been in all her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot always be with you,&rdquo; said the 
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there is One who &lsquo;will never leave 
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; How beautiful he has made everything about 
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she looked upon the green earth, with the 
peeping flowers, and upon the delicate shrubs that skirted the 
roadside, and the wild-roses and creeping plants along the 
hedges, and then she looked up into the blue heavens, with such 
an expression of love that the child gazed at her with 
rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a good God!&rdquo; said the lady, still looking up
with the bright light upon her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;And such a 
wondrously beautiful world, where we may walk joyously, with his 
love in our hearts as well as all about our <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>path; and yet
we sit in the dust weeping, and forget that he is our Father, and
that he is watching for us to turn towards him&mdash;poor, 
wandering, wayward children that we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the lady spoke as if to herself, the child knew that 
she was thinking of her; for she had not quite put away the shame
of her first appearance; and she touched her white hand timidly 
with her brown finger, and said, really in earnest, &ldquo;I 
won&rsquo;t sit in the dirt again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dear child,&rdquo; said her 
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must never again forget that, although 
you are poor, and must live in this world for a while, you are in
truth a little exiled princess, and your glorious home is with 
the great King, your Father, in the skies; and it does not become
the daughter of so great a King to put herself on a level with 
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>the beasts; but you must lift yourself up more and more 
towards heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl looked at her, and straightened her figure to 
its greatest possible height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to carry yourself proudly, as the daughter of an 
earthly king might do,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;but be 
above doing a mean or low thing, and try to be heavenly and pure,
like your blessed Lord and Father; and then he will lift you up 
to his beautiful, high throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s head drooped again, and she looked 
despondingly at her teacher, as if she did not really know what 
to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;but I
shall come once a week to see how you get on.&nbsp; I shall not 
expect the cobwebs to gather any more in the cottage, nor the 
dust to collect upon the floor, nor to shut out the sun from the 
window, nor the little <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>princess&rsquo;s face to be dirty and
ugly; because that would offend the pure and holy God, who made 
this world fresh and clean and beautiful, and expects his 
children to keep it so.&nbsp; Do you think you will remember 
&lsquo;Our Father&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who art in heaven,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the child,
calling to mind the prayer taught her some time in her life, but 
long since almost forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in heaven <i>only</i>, dear child,&rdquo; said the 
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to think of him as close beside you
always, wherever you go.&nbsp; Can you read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady opened a pocket-Bible, and drawing the little girl 
closer to her, said, &ldquo;Now, say after me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither 
shall I flee from thy presence?&nbsp; If I ascend up into heaven,
thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art 
there.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>If I take the wings of the morning, 
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy
hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.&nbsp; If I say, 
Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light
about me.&nbsp; Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the 
night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both 
alike to thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my dear child,&rdquo; said she, as she 
reverently closed the book, &ldquo;we cannot get away from God if
we would, and surely we would not try to hide ourselves from so 
kind a Friend and Father if we could.&nbsp; Only when we are 
doing something that we are ashamed of do we shun the face of one
who loves us; and if we try to flee from the eye of God we may be
sure we are guilty of some wickedness.&nbsp; How much sweeter is 
it to do <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>what we know will please him, and 
look freely up into his face, as a good child delights to meet 
his earthly parent&rsquo;s smile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady rose to go, and the child looked wistfully at her and
then at the little Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes; I will give you this.&nbsp; It will tell you 
what to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she put the book into the 
child&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will read a chapter every 
day till I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl gladly promised, but was sad at the parting; 
for never an hour passed so cheerily as the hour with the kind 
teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I&rsquo;ll come again, for <i>He</i> 
sends me,&rdquo; said the lady.&nbsp; And she looked up once more
with the heavenly face, and then stooped till her soft lips 
touched the child&rsquo;s forehead; and, while the pressure of 
the gentle kiss thrilled through the very <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>soul of the 
little girl, her friend was gone.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Did she come again?&rdquo; asked Maddie, who had got 
upon her knees in front of Alice, with mouth and eyes and ears 
wide open for the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; many and many a time,&rdquo; said Alice.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And she taught the little girl to see her Father&rsquo;s 
love in the trees, and the flowers, and all about, as she walked 
amid his beautiful creation; and she learned to be a neat, tidy 
little girl, instead of the dirty, miserable creature that sat 
crying in the dirt by the roadside when she first saw her 
friend.&nbsp; The lady taught her to look upon herself as greatly
beloved by her Father, and after that she was not miserable any 
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>&ldquo;Did you ever see the little princess?&rdquo; 
asked Lolly, raising her head from Alice&rsquo;s lap and looking 
earnestly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&nbsp; Every day since the lady came to 
her,&rdquo; said Alice.&nbsp; &ldquo;She lives in the same 
cottage now; but it has grown to be a beautiful place; for 
God&rsquo;s flowers are all about it, and God&rsquo;s sun streams
in at the window, and all over the mossy roof, like a golden 
flood,&mdash;and God himself is always with her to keep her from 
harm and from being lonely or sad.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as Alice said
this, the tears glistened in her blue eyes, as the dew-drops 
sparkle through the sunlight in the violets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see her now,&rdquo; continued she; 
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you two other little exiled 
princesses.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she took Lolly and Maddie down by 
the brook-side, and bade them look in <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>her great 
mirror; and there they saw themselves and Alice&mdash;all 
children of the great King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now I know!&rdquo; said Maddie, clapping her 
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> are the little princess, Alice, 
and Miss Mason is the good lady.&nbsp; Is she so nice as all 
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Just as nice</i>, dear Maddie,&rdquo; replied Alice;
&ldquo;and if you and Lolly will go with me to the Sunday-school,
she&rsquo;ll tell us a great many more beautiful stories, to help
us on our way to our heavenly home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come.&nbsp; It is nearly time for us to go 
now.&nbsp; Mother will be looking for me.&nbsp; 
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the little girl with the sunny heart bounded into the 
cottage with a smile and a kiss for her mother.</p>
<h2><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>When Alice left the children, they went sauntering along the 
road towards home.&nbsp; Very slowly they walked, and not 
joyously and hopefully, as little children do who think of their 
father&rsquo;s house as the brightest and dearest spot in the 
whole world.</p>
<p>It was a long distance from the brown cottage of their friend;
but the freshness of the evening made it delightful to be out, 
and they had been resting so many hours that they were not 
weary.&nbsp; Besides, the twinkling stars came out in the sky, 
and there was shining above them the calm, bright moon; and 
altogether it was so serene and lovely, that they almost wished 
they could be always walking in some pleasant path that should 
have no unpleasant thing at the end&mdash;such as they felt their
home <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>to be.&nbsp; Presently they came to a bend in the road, 
and a few steps from the corner was a low-roofed house, a 
ruinous-looking place, with rags stuffed in the broken 
window-panes.&nbsp; There were green fields around it, and tall 
trees gracefully waving near it; but the old house spoiled the 
landscape by its slovenly, shabby appearance.</p>
<p>A dim light was burning in the room nearest the children; and 
as they approached, they could see their father and mother 
sitting at a table, eating their coarse supper of bread and cold 
salt pork.</p>
<p>Lolly thought what a pleasant table Alice had by the 
brook-side, and the scent of the violets seemed even now to reach
her, and the music of the waters was in her ears, and the bright,
happy face of her little playmate came freshly before her, making
the dingy room where her parents sat, <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>with the 
gloom of the dim light and the tattered dusty furniture, still 
more uninviting and cheerless.</p>
<p>Lolly lingered outside the door, while Maddie entered.&nbsp; 
She sat down upon the step, and called to mind all that Alice had
said to them that day.</p>
<p>She was younger than Maddie by a year or two, but her soul was
older&mdash;that is, it was more thoughtful and earnest; and 
instead of dwelling always on the things of earth, she had a 
wistful longing for something higher and better, which 
Alice&rsquo;s words had begun to satisfy.</p>
<p>The cool breeze played upon her cheek, and the sound of the 
air, as it rustled the leaves, and the breath of the 
flower-scented meadows fell soothingly upon her senses; and as 
she looked up into the starry sky, with its myriads of gleaming 
lights, and recalled the story, she felt within herself <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that 
indeed she was a little princess as well as Alice, and that far 
above all the glory of the heavens her Father was awaiting her 
return to the heavenly palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maddie and I mustn&rsquo;t forget these things,&rdquo; 
said she to herself; &ldquo;but must try to get ready for our 
better home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much was Lolly thinking of the things she had heard in the 
story, that she might have sat there in the dew all night, but 
that her mother called her to eat her supper and go to bed.</p>
<p>Maddie was already fast asleep upon a trundle-bed, that was 
pushed under the great bed by day, and drawn out at night; for 
there were only the two rooms in the house, and they had to make 
the most of all the space.</p>
<p>Lolly had never felt the house so small and close as on this 
night; for <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>her soul was swelling with such large
free thoughts, that the four narrow walls of the bedroom seemed 
to press in upon her and almost to stop her breath.</p>
<p>She could not go to bed until she had opened the window and 
looked up once more into the bright sky; and as she did so, she 
said very earnestly, &ldquo;O my Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not know any prayers.&nbsp; She had never been taught 
to call upon God.&nbsp; Most that she had ever heard of the other
life was through Alice&rsquo;s story that day; and her heart was 
so glad of the knowledge, that it already began to go out towards
her heavenly home and her gracious Father.</p>
<p>As she spoke these words, there came such a happy feeling to 
her spirit&mdash;a feeling that she was not alone, but that she 
was watched over <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and protected; and with a sense of 
security and safety, such as she had never before known, she lay 
down beside her sister, and was soon sweetly slumbering.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>Lolly was awakened in the morning by the fretful voice of her 
mother, as she went scolding about the house, trying to pick up 
something for breakfast; and she heard her father answering her 
in no pleasant mood, and kicking about the floor whatever came in
his way.</p>
<p>It was a sad awakening for poor Lolly, and, for the minute, it
put wholly out of her mind the pleasure of the previous day, and 
the lesson learned in the green and sunny place by the 
brook-side; and she was sorely <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>tempted to 
cover her head with the bed-clothes, and sleep again, until her 
parents were off to their work, and then give herself up to 
idleness and play, as she had always done.&nbsp; But the bright 
happy face of Alice came before her to help her, and she was out 
of bed in a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maddie, Maddie!&rdquo; said she, leaning over her 
sister and giving her the least bit of a shake in order to arouse
her; &ldquo;come, get up.&nbsp; The sun is shining on the wall, 
and it is a beautiful day.&nbsp; I want you to go with me for 
Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; returned Maddie in a huff.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept half enough!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, 
settling herself again, she dropped off into a heavier slumber; 
while Lolly, seeing that it would do no good to disturb her, 
dressed herself and went into the other room.</p>
<p>Her mother was baking a cake, and <!-- page 41--><a 
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>her father 
sat near, idle.&nbsp; Both looked surprised to see Lolly up so 
early.</p>
<p>There was a woollen-factory in the village, perhaps half a 
mile away, and they were off generally long before the children 
were up; and Maddie and Lolly usually ate such pickings as they 
left upon the table, and spent their days as they pleased, with 
little thought or care from their parents.</p>
<p>Lolly could not wait to get her breakfast.&nbsp; She cared for
nothing to eat, now that her mind was intent upon some great 
thing, and she sped away over the dewy grass to find her new 
friend.&nbsp; She had never been in Alice&rsquo;s house, for they
had only lived a little while in the place where they now were, 
and Maddie alone had found out their neighbour.&nbsp; Her sister 
would not always let her play with her, and it was only a mere 
chance that led her to follow Maddie <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the day 
before and get acquainted with Alice.</p>
<p>I did not mean to say <i>chance</i>.&nbsp; I would rather say 
a kind watchful <i>Providence</i>&mdash;which is the true and 
right word for a Christian to use; because everything that 
happens in this world is governed by God&rsquo;s over-ruling 
power for some good purpose; and Lolly was led to the spot where 
her sister and Alice were at play, expressly that she might learn
something of her bright, eternal home.</p>
<p>Now that she had seen the sunny-hearted little girl once, it 
took her but very few minutes to find her again.</p>
<p>The distance seemed nothing at all; and, from the time she 
left her own door, she could see the cheerful face all along her 
way, making her walk very pleasant and not in the least 
lonely.</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>The cottage door was wide open, and the sunlight lay in 
golden streaks on the floor at the entrance, where Tabby had 
stretched herself comfortably.&nbsp; Lolly could see into the 
little square room at the right.</p>
<p>The table was spread with a neat, white cloth, and Alice and 
her mother were eating their breakfast together.&nbsp; There were
two white plates on the table, and white cups and saucers, and a 
smoking dish of porridge.&nbsp; All this Lolly could see as she 
stood hesitating near the door; but, in a minute, Alice caught a 
glimpse of her little, shy face, and ran to lead her in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have some of this nice breakfast,&rdquo; said 
she, giving Lolly a plateful of the porridge, and pouring some 
milk on it from a small white pitcher.</p>
<p>Lolly looked timidly at Alice&rsquo;s mother, to see if she 
might eat it; and <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the kind pleasant smile she received 
made her feel quite at home, so that she needed no further 
urging.</p>
<p>Soon after the mother went away, and left Alice to put the 
room in order; and, when all things were right, Alice said 
&ldquo;she could go with Lolly as well as not that day, and they 
would make a pretty place of the shabby cottage; for it was just 
in the best spot&mdash;so wild and shady and green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was rather a sorrowful task at the beginning, and almost 
any other little girl than Alice would have been quite 
discouraged.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of rubbish in the sitting-room, and the
floor and windows looked as if they had never known anything of 
soap and water.&nbsp; Maddie sat upon the top of a half-barrel, 
swinging her brown, soiled feet, and playing with a black puppy, 
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>that was snapping at her toes; while the table was 
strewn with crumbs and dirty dishes from the morning&rsquo;s 
meal, and chips and sticks and bits of rags were upon the 
floor.</p>
<p>She looked as if she had just got out of bed.&nbsp; Her face 
was dull, and her hair showed no touch of brush or comb, and her 
nails were long and dirty; but she jumped from her perch with 
some signs of shame as she saw Alice, so neat and tidy, at the 
door; and she began to scramble about as if she wished to make 
things a little better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I help you to-day, Maddie?&rdquo; asked 
Alice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any work at home, and I like 
to get things tidy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make such a room of this 
before night!&rdquo; And, without another word, she began in 
earnest to bring order out of strange confusion.</p>
<p>Lolly was a capital helper, because <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>her heart was
in the matter, and she really wanted a pleasant, cheerful home; 
but Maddie was content to look on, and scarcely moved a finger to
help.</p>
<p>They packed away the wood and chips in the closet under the 
lowest shelf, and washed the dishes and set them up edgewise in 
their proper places; and they mopped the floor, and scrubbed the 
windows and table, and brought boughs of evergreen to hang upon 
the nails around the walls and make it cheerful and pretty.</p>
<p>Alice thought of this.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Rich folks hang 
paintings on their walls&mdash;and these are God&rsquo;s 
pictures, the work of his almighty fingers, and so 
beautiful!&nbsp; Why not put them where we can always look at 
them, and in them see his love and kindness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly thought her the most wonderful <!-- page 47--><a 
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>little girl 
in all the world, and clapped her hands for joy as she looked 
upon the altered room.</p>
<p>Then they went outside, and swept the sticks and chips from 
the lawn; and Maddie managed to hunt up a hammer and some old 
rusty nails, and to help Alice to fasten the loose boards upon 
the door, which improved it more than anything else could do.</p>
<p>It was so low from the roof to the ground that by stepping on 
a chair they could easily reach; and they trained a running 
rose-bush, that had been long neglected, and hung, trailing, over
the grass, so that it nearly covered the whole side of the 
cottage, and would soon be like a bright green mantle over the 
dark walls.</p>
<h2><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>Just as they had finished their labours, and Alice had 
prevailed upon Maddie to put herself in a little better order, 
and the three young friends had seated themselves upon the step 
to get something from Alice&rsquo;s Bible&mdash;some words of 
love and blessing, as Alice said, from their heavenly 
Father&mdash;there came a lady up the road towards them.&nbsp; 
She was walking very slowly along, with her parasol shielding her
face, so that it was quite concealed from the children; but Alice
knew her dress, and ran quickly to meet her, crying joyously, 
&ldquo;It is Miss Mason, dear Lolly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddie ran into the cottage and hid behind the door, like a 
foolish little girl; but Lolly sat still, very glad that the good
teacher was coming to speak to her, yet trembling with a <!-- 
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>sort of nervous fear; because she was a shy little girl,
and so seldom saw strangers.</p>
<p>She wondered that Alice dared go so fearlessly up and walk 
along, with her hand in Miss Mason&rsquo;s hand, and her face 
upturned towards the lady&rsquo;s, while she talked as freely as 
if it had been herself or Maddie listening.&nbsp; But when Miss 
Mason stood by the step and stooped down to kiss her sun-burned 
cheek, and said sweetly, &ldquo;So this is your little friend 
Lolly, is it, Alice?&rdquo; she did not wonder any longer; for 
her heart leaped to meet the gentle lady, and she could not take 
her eyes from such a kind and loving face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Maddie?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason, with a 
smile.</p>
<p>She could see her peeping through the crack of the door; and, 
understanding the case, she said carelessly,&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>&ldquo;I suppose she will join us by-and-by.&nbsp; We 
will sit here and read in Alice&rsquo;s book until she comes, and
then I want to talk to you.&nbsp; Alice told me you lived here, 
Lolly, and I want you to go to the Sunday-school.&nbsp; We are 
very happy there, are we not, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice answered with a beaming face, and she and Lolly sat, one
on each side of the teacher, and listened as she read to them 
from God&rsquo;s holy Word.</p>
<p>She read first about the creation of this beautiful world, and
the garden where Adam and Eve were placed; and, when she had made
Lolly and Maddie understand all about how sin came&mdash;for 
Maddie, attracted by the sweet voice and pleasant manner, had 
crept softly from her hiding-place and curled herself upon the 
step behind the lady&mdash;Miss Mason turned to the <!-- page 
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>New 
Testament and read to them a few verses about Jesus, who took 
upon himself our nature and suffered for our sins.</p>
<p>The children were much impressed by the story of the 
Saviour&rsquo;s sufferings and death; and when the teacher told 
them that every naughty word and deed of theirs was like a nail 
in the Saviour&rsquo;s feet or hands, they felt that they would 
never again do a wicked thing.</p>
<p>Then she told them how impossible it would be for them to keep
from sin without God&rsquo;s continual help; and she taught them 
how to look up to him and ask for his aid and blessing.&nbsp; And
when she had made sure that they could say a short prayer, and 
had obtained a promise from them that they would go every Sunday 
to the Sunday-school, she kissed them all three very 
affectionately, and went on to search <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>for others of
her heavenly Father&rsquo;s wandering children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she had gone quite out of sight, and they were 
taking another good look at the changed rooms, that seemed so 
grand to them all, Lolly said thoughtfully to Alice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the great King will like to come here 
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> here,&rdquo; said Alice reverently.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel it, Lolly?&nbsp; We never see him, 
you know, as we see each other; but we feel that he is near, just
as you feel that your mother is in the room even when the 
darkness hides her from your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly repeated the little prayer softly, &ldquo;O my heavenly 
Father, I will try to love thee.&nbsp; Wilt thou not come unto 
me, and be with me wherever I am, and help me to be thy 
child?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as she said the words, she knew that God
was with her, and <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>that from that hour there was a 
Presence in the house that would drive away all the gloom, and 
make such brightness as filled the cottage of her little 
friend.</p>
<p>It was time for Alice to go; but she lingered a little while 
longer to teach Maddie how to prepare the supper, so that when 
her mother came home weary from her labour, there might be no 
more hard work for her to do, but real comfort and rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get tired of housekeeping,&rdquo; said
she, as she tied on her sun-bonnet to go.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall 
run over some day to see how you get on; and I&rsquo;m sure 
it&rsquo;s so much prettier to be sweet, and clean, and tidy, 
that you&rsquo;ll love to keep the house nice.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
away she tripped to make things pleasant for her own dear, 
hard-working mother.</p>
<p>Sunny little girl!&nbsp; She knew how <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>many tiresome
steps her diligent hands and loving heart could save her poor 
widowed mother; and in everything she did there was a tender 
thought of the warm heart against which her infant head had lain 
when her little feet and hands were weak and helpless.</p>
<p>She was glad now that they had grown strong to aid, that she 
could give back some of the care and effort.&nbsp; Alice never 
dreamed of growing impatient in her mother&rsquo;s service.&nbsp;
She did not wait to be asked to help her, but watched for 
opportunities, and so proved a great blessing and treasure in the
lowly cottage home, that would have been very dismal and sad 
without her sunny, buoyant little body.</p>
<h2><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>Peter Rand and his wife came lagging up the road as the sun 
was setting.&nbsp; They had passed an uncommonly laborious day, 
and were completely tired out with their toil.&nbsp; They were 
very silent, and were thinking what a sad, miserable home was 
theirs, and how little of cheer they had in life.&nbsp; Nothing 
seemed bright to them, although the earth was like a paradise for
greenness and fragrance and beauty.&nbsp; As they drew near the 
house, Mr. Rand was very much surprised by the great change in 
the outward aspect of the place.&nbsp; He could scarcely believe 
that he had not mistaken the road, and come to some other cottage
than the slovenly one that he had left in the morning.</p>
<p>His wife, intent upon the supper that her hungry appetite 
craved, had <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>pressed forward in haste to prepare 
it.</p>
<p>As she entered the door, however, she started back with the 
strange feeling that she was in the house of some neighbour; but 
Pug, the little dog, ran frisking about her, and convinced her 
that is was indeed her own house.</p>
<p>The table was set in the middle of the room, and the dishes 
were arranged in nice order; and just in the centre was 
Lolly&rsquo;s pewter mug, with a bunch of sweet, blue violets to 
grace it all.</p>
<p>There was the savoury odour of the baking cake from the fire, 
and the fumes of the steeping tea filled the room, and already 
gave a sense of refreshing to the weary work-people.</p>
<p>The rags were taken from the windows, and square bits of paper
were pinned over the openings; and the floor was neat and clean, 
and the beautiful green boughs hung upon the <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>walls, and 
the children sat, with clean hands and faces, awaiting the return
of father and mother.</p>
<p>They looked so bright and happy that the weary couple quite 
forgot their fatigue, and chatted merrily over their pleasant 
meal, praising the children for their thoughtful work, and saying
they didn&rsquo;t believe there was a more beautiful home in the 
world than theirs.</p>
<p>Altogether, it was a very happy evening.&nbsp; Maddie and 
Lolly made their father and mother sit down quietly while they 
cleared off the table, and washed the dishes, and swept the 
crumbs away; and then they all had a cozy little time, talking of
new hopes and plans.&nbsp; For the change was so comfortable that
it put life and spirits into every soul; and the father said he 
would get some glass and putty and mend the windows; <!-- page 
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>and 
the mother would make some white curtains, and the children would
get evergreen and form it into wreaths to loop them up.&nbsp; Oh,
it takes so little to make a cheerful, happy home!&nbsp; It is 
only the idle and vicious that need be really miserable.&nbsp; If
God does not always give us plenty of money, he furnishes us with
so many rich things in this world of his, that we may adorn even 
a lowly and barren place until it shall appear richer than the 
gayest palace.&nbsp; Maddie and Lolly found this out through 
Alice; and every day they hunted the woods for mosses and 
flowers, and their father made little shelves to put them on, and
formed many a pretty seat of twisted branches of trees; so that 
by-and-by their cottage was one of the prettiest places anywhere 
around, and attracted the notice of everybody that passed it.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>Miss Mason came very often, now that she had found them 
out; and she not only prevailed on the parents to send their 
children to Sunday-school, but they themselves went regularly to 
church, and tried to serve the great and holy God who had put it 
into the hearts of their children to make their earthly place of 
abode something akin to the better home.</p>
<p>So soon as they began to feel the presence of the heavenly 
King, all the despondency and gloom vanished, and, even though 
poor and hard-working, they were happy in the possession of such 
riches as nothing but the love and favour of our heavenly Father 
can give.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>It was not very long after the children learned to look away 
from earth <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>to the blest abode beyond the skies, 
when Lolly began to droop and grow weak and listless; and, 
although her parents and Maddie thought it was but a trifling 
illness, she herself felt that her Father was about to call her 
home.&nbsp; She was not afraid to die; and, when she grew so 
languid that her little feet lost the power to take her to the 
Sunday-school, Miss Mason and Alice and the kind minister came 
often to talk to her of her approaching joy.</p>
<p>There was one beautiful little story that the minister used to
tell her over and over again, she liked it so much.&nbsp; I do 
not know whether he made it, or whether he got it from some book;
but I want to tell it to you, for I like it as well as Lolly 
did.&nbsp; It is this:&mdash;&ldquo;There was a bright, beautiful
butterfly that was about to die.&nbsp; She had laid her eggs on a
cabbage-leaf in <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the garden; and, as she thought of 
her children, she said to a caterpillar that was crawling upon 
the leaf, &lsquo;I am going to die.&nbsp; I feel my strength fast
failing, and I want you to take care of my little 
ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caterpillar promised, and the butterfly folded her 
wings and breathed her last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the caterpillar did not know what to do.&nbsp; She
wanted some instruction with regard to her charge: so she thought
she would ask a lark, that went soaring up into the blue 
sky.&nbsp; At first the lark was silent, and plumed his wings and
went up&mdash;up&mdash;up, as if to gather wisdom for his answer;
and then he came, singing, down and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something about your charge;
but you won&rsquo;t believe me.&nbsp; These young butterflies 
that you look for will become caterpillars.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poh! poh!&rsquo; said the old 
caterpillar.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; I told you you wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And 
what do you suppose they will live upon?&rsquo; said the 
lark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, the dew and the sweet honey from the 
flowers, to be sure,&rsquo; replied the caterpillar.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;That is what all butterflies live on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t, indeed,&rsquo; said the 
lark.&nbsp; &lsquo;They will eat cabbage-leaves.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he went soaring away again into the clear heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently, back he came and said to the 
caterpillar,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something stranger still 
about yourself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be a beautiful 
butterfly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caterpillar laughed at the idea; but, as she turned
around and saw the eggs upon the leaf all hatched into little 
crawling caterpillars, she was forced to believe what the lark 
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>had said concerning herself; and she went about as happy
as could be, telling everybody what a glorious change would come 
to her after she had folded herself in her close 
chrysalis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister told Lolly that this caterpillar in the chrysalis
was like us worms of the dust when lying in the narrow grave 
enshrouded in our death-robes; and that, like as the caterpillar 
bursts his darksome bonds and soars away upon butterfly pinions, 
so shall we come forth from the tomb on the resurrection day, and
with angel-wings mount upward to the world of light and 
peace.&nbsp; Then he read a few verses to her from that beautiful
account of the rising from the dead, in the fifteenth chapter of 
the First Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>
<p>Lolly would lie upon her sick-bed and fasten her earnest eyes 
upon him as he read and as he spoke so sweetly <!-- page 64--><a 
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>to her of the
other life; and then she would look away through the open window 
to the heavens above, and seem to see the face of her Father, who
was drawing her slowly to himself.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
